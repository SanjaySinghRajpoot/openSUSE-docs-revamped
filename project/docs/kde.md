### Settings & Keybindings

KDE settings can be customized through the __System Settings__ application found in
_Application Launcher --> Settings --> System Settings_. A convenient shortcut for System Settings can be found on the system panel as well.
KDE is extremely customizabl,to find more specific help visit the [Plasma Wiki](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma)

Keybindings or keyboard shortcuts are an efficient way to interact with KDE without having to use the mouse.

In __System Settings__ click __Shortcuts__ under the "Workspace" category.
You will be able to find any pre-existing shortcuts for many KDE applications as well as create your own shortcuts for any applications you install yourself.
The __Custom Shortcuts__ menu allows you to create shortcuts for almost any system task.
<br><br>
The Shortcuts window has three main areas.

* The shortcut categories, __Shortcuts__ and __Custom Shortcuts__.
* List of applications or custom shortcuts.
* Shortcut editing area.

Many KDE applications are already in the list. If you want to add additional applications simply
click __Add Application__ and make a selection from the list. Click __OK__ to confirm the selection.

Once this step is done, the new application will be displayed in the Applications column.

#### Changing Keyboard Shortcuts

Select the application you want to change the shortcut for from the Applications column. The list of shortcut actions will be displayed in the editing area on the right. Click on any shortcut action to expand its settings (if there is only one shortcut available it will be automatically expanded).
<br>
Shortcut actions can have default and custom keyboard shortcuts. You can disable the default by un-marking the box next to it or leave it active alongside any custom shortcuts you choose.

Click __Add custom shortcut__, the button will change to indicate it is waiting for the next key combination, whatever keys are pressed next will be recorded as the custom shortcut. Click the "cancel" button, which has now appeared, if you change your mind. When a custom shortcut is recorded, you have the option to delete it by clicking the "trash" icon or additional custom shortcuts can be added.

# Welcome
Are you looking for **better** Linux documentation? You are in the right place. This is a young project that aims
to provide a user friendly guide for quickly installing and setting up openSUSE with minimum fuss.

## For new users
The documentation is laid out in a user friendly way. It caters to beginners and other people new to Linux, and helps you get running quickly. Installing Linux can seem daunting at first, because there are a lot of new concepts, choices, and options. Choice is good, but it can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing.

Initially, the installation instruction will cover only the necessary options and configuration choices to help you quickly set up a running system with defaults suitable for daily use. With the system running and productive you can learn how to perform different routine system tasks such as installing apps, adjusting the system settings, or customizing openSUSE. And, if you're so inclined, start honing your Linux skills.

## For experienced users
For experienced Linux users the documentation includes short pointers on how things are done in
openSUSE and how things are different to other Linux distros. Links to advanced topics are provided to get you acquainted with the system, and quickly up and running.

## Documentation sections

### Pre-install
The pre-install documentation gives you everything you need to get a system running. This can be a simple installation using default settings, or you can make a few choices, such as choosing a desktop environment. You can find out more about things like desktop environments in this section.

For experienced users, this section describes what differentiates openSUSE from other distros, and helps you get to know the unique features and make informed choices during the install process. For example, find out about the power of snapshots using Btrfs, advanced distros featuring atomic transactional updates, and distros designed to run container loads.

### Install
Now that you have a plan, this section will walk you through preparing installation media, and performing the installation based on the choice you made during pre-install.

Experienced users will find a quick reference covering notable installation options and procedures.

> At this stage and with minimum fuss you will have a running system with sane defaults that is ready for daily use. From here you can move forward and find out more as you need.

### Operating system (OS) orientation
This section contains walk-throughs for the different features of Linux in general and openSUSE in particular. It covers the user interface, system settings, installing and upgrading
software, and general good computing practices. You will also learn how to use unique openSUSE features like YaST and snapshots.

### After install setup
This section covers setting up devices, such as printers, scanners, or a dedicated graphics card. You will also find information on how to install software that is not in the official openSUSE software repositories.

### Advanced install
If you are an experienced user you might want to set up your system in a particular way to take
advantage of the latest Linux technologies. This section contains information about how to set up openSUSE with technologies such as advanced partitioning schemes, encryption,
display servers, vulnerability mitigation, and similar.

### Advanced topics
Now that you're familiar with Linux and openSUSE, you want to get the most out of it. This section contains information on doing more advanced tasks with YaST, Zypper, Snapper, and other tools.
